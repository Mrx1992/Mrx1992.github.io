# 参数详细2

## `--info=FLAGS`

An individual flag name may be followed by a level number, with 0 meaning to silence that output, 1 being the default output level, and higher numbers increasing the output of that flag (for those that support higher levels). 
Use  --info=help to see all the available flag names, what they output, and what flag names are added for each increase in the verbose level. 

这个选项可以对你想看到的输出信息进行更精细的控制。
一个单独的标志名称前面可以跟着一个级别数字，
0意味着静默输出，
1意味着默认输出，
更高的数字会增加该标志的输出。
更高的级别数可以使用--info=help去查看支持的标志名，它们的输出，以及每次增加verbose级别时增加的标志名。

如下：
```
BACKUP     Mention files backed up                                      提及已备份的文件
COPY       Mention files copied locally on the receiving side           提及在接收方本地复制的文件
DEL        Mention deletions on the receiving side                      在接收方提及删除
FLIST      Mention file-list receiving/sending (levels 1-2)             提及文件清单的接收/发送(第1-2级)
MISC       Mention miscellaneous information (levels 1-2)
MOUNT      Mention mounts that were found or skipped
NAME       Mention 1) updated file/dir names, 2) unchanged names
PROGRESS   Mention 1) per-file progress or 2) total transfer progress
REMOVE     Mention files removed on the sending side
SKIP       Mention files that are skipped due to options used
STATS      Mention statistics at end of run (levels 1-3)
SYMSAFE    Mention symlinks that are unsafe

ALL        Set all --info options (e.g. all4)
NONE       Silence all --info options (same as all0)
HELP       Output this help message
```

Some examples:

rsync -a --info=progress2 src/ dest/
rsync -avv --info=stats2,misc1,flist0 src/ dest/

Note that --info=name's output is affected by the --out-format and --itemize-changes (-i) options. See those options for more information on what is output and when.

This option was added to 3.1.0, so an older rsync on the server side might reject your attempts at fine-grained control (if one or more flags needed to be send to the server and the server was too old to understand them). See also the "max verbosity" caveat above when dealing with a daemon.
